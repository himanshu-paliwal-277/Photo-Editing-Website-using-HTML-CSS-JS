## Photo Editing Website

This project is a simple yet functional Photo Editing Website that I developed as part of my journey to learn web development.

The primary goal of this project is to apply and showcase the skills I've acquired as a beginner in web development, including understanding of web technologies and responsive design principles. It's designed to be simple, user-friendly, and accessible to all users interested in basic photo editing tasks.
